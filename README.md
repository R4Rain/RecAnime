## RecAnime
A Chatbot built in website that can suggest anime based on user's interest and user's favorite anime.

## How to run
- Set up virtual environment (optional)
```
pip install virtualenv 
python -m venv env
```

- Activate virtual environment (windows version)
```
env/Scripts/activate.bat
```

- Install all packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the website server along with the chatbot
```
python app.py
```

- Open the local host `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

Note: You can just run `chatbot.py` to interact with the chatbot without displaying through the website

My python version: 3.9.13
